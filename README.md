# EPL-standings

The idea was to use a graph based data structure to store matches data of the English premier league, and construct a league standings table using this graph

It was done using two appraoches, <br>
- Adj_list approach that takes total time complexity of O(M log M) where M is the number of matches in the csv file
- Adj_matrix approach that takes total yime complexity of O(M) where M is the number of matches in the csv file
